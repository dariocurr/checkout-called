# checkout-called

Checkout the called repository at the same reference it was invoked with

## Why

Following the discussion [here](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/issues/1264),
since evidently there is not enough [dogfeeding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) happening at @github,
I created `checkout-called` to simplify checking out the called repository in your [reusable workflows](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/sharing-automations/reusing-workflows)

## Usage

To use this action in your called workflows and check out the repository automatically, add the following lines:

```yml
- name: Checkout called repo
  uses: dariocurr/checkout-called@main
```

This action mirrors the arguments of [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout), except for `ref` and `repository` that are injected automatically based on the call.

For example, if you call: `user/repository/.github/workflows/workflow.yml@branch`, it will checkout the `user/repository` repository using `branch` as reference

> This repository is committed to maintaining compatibility and same version as [`actions/checkout`](https://github.com/actions/checkout)

### Â Private repository

According to the GitHub API [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/actions/workflow-runs?apiVersion=2022-11-28#get-a-workflow-run),
for private repositories, you need to provide a token with `Actions: read` permissions.
To do this, pass the token as an argument:

```yml
- name: Checkout called repo
  uses: dariocurr/checkout-called@main
  with:
    token: ${{ secrets.TOKEN }}
 ```

### Nested workflows

When working with nested reusable workflows (as desribed in issue [#5](https://github.com/dariocurr/checkout-called/issues/5)), the GitHub API for workflow runs does not guarantee the order of the `referenced_workflows`.
This means we cannot rely on `referenced_workflows[0]` being the correct workflow to use.

Thus, in order to ensure the correctness of the execution, add the `workflow` argument:

```yml
- name: Checkout called repo
  uses: dariocurr/checkout-called@main
  with:
    workflow: organization/repository/.github/workflows/workflow.yml
 ```

> The `workflow` argument is used to perform a substring search. A full workflow reference like `organization/repository/.github/workflows/workflow.yml` should be used to avoid conflicts when multiple workflows have the same name
